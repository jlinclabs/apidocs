## Introduction
The JLINC protocol takes place primarily between two servers.

One server represents the business, enterprise or organization's interests, and is named the "B" server.

The other server represents the end-user's interests, and is named the "A" server.

For the sake of intelligibility, we call the organization user "BobCo" and the individual end-user "Alice".

These docs describe the protocols for front-end applications to access the A server for Alice and the B server for BobCo.
